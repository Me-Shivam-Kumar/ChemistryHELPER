# ChemistryHELPER
This is my first project and a step towards a long journey i hope you will like it.
This project is already published in the google play store and you can check it using this link "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chemistryaid.chemistryaid"
I had removed assets folder used in this project and this folder contains all the pdf's that are used. In the code whenever you find this code pdfView.fromAsset("reduction_iitb_original.pdf").load();
this simply means that i am displaying the pdf name "reduction_iitb_original.pdf" in the pdf view from the assets folder.
